# Tree-Data-Structure
Trees
The Following code implements a Tree Data Structure. Trees are hierarchical data structures.

Why Trees?
1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer.
2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.

The provided code also implements various functions that could be a applied on a tree. These are:
- Height of Tree
- Print kth Level of a Tree
- LevelOrder Printing
- Breadth First Search
- PreOrder Traversal
- Count of Nodes
- Sum of Nodes
- Diameter of Tree
- Deleting a node
- Checking whether the tree is balanced or not?
- Building Tree from Array
- Building a Binary Search Tree
- Deleting a node in Binary Search Tree
- Searching in a Binary Search Tree 
,and a few others...

# Happy Coding!
